              Despite my wife’s best efforts, pushing through sickness and total exhaustion, our darling daughter didn’t want to come out that way. There was only one thing for it… out the sunroof.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the bright lights of the operating theatre, hearing the words ‘knife to skin’, it all become very real. I was seconds away from becoming a parent.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I peered over the curtain to see my daughter for the first time I struggled to grasp reality. ‘That can’t be her, can it?’ I thought. It was a wonderfully strange sensation. This little person that I’d been reading stories to for the last nine months was suddenly thrust into the world. She was now my responsibility and would rely on me for everything.
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps I was overcome with emotion, but all of a sudden I felt extremely unprepared. Despite attending two separate sets of antenatal classes, when I had to dress Liberty for the first time, I didn't have a clue. It's all good when you’re practicing on a plastic doll but nothing prepares you for dressing a wiggly, squishy, miniature human.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next two days in hospital were a breeze. Maybe this parenting thing isn’t so tough afterall? The first dirty nappy that’s like tar? No problem. Dressing and washing? Not so bad. But then this wasn’t reality. As tough as it was going home every night, I was able to sleep soundly in my own bed, void of all responsibility (and late night feeds). That was about to change.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next few nights at home were a real rollercoaster. The night she cried solidly for 3 hours from 2am really put my limited parenting repertoire to the test. Is she too hot? Is her nappy dirty? Is she getting enough food? Am I starving my child?!... It certainly sounded like it. These long stretches of turmoil are easily outweighed by the joy she can bring from a simple smile. It really is amazing.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s in these moments when she’s quiet and content that, dare I say it, this feels so easy and I can’t wait for what’s next. I just have a feeling that two weeks paternity leave just won’t feel like long enough.

              I’d heard labour described as “Apocalypse Now” and “the Exorcist in real life”. Even the midwife referred to the Labour Ward as a “torture chamber” when we heard screams - and I mean SCREAMS - emanating from down the hall. But the truth is, it was all pretty painless and straightforward, my body and mind leaving the hospital healthy and intact (I can’t say the same for the Wife’s vagina). Honestly, if I had to describe labour in one word, I would say ‘boring’.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, I was expecting to be utterly traumatised so it helps that I ended up only being mildly inconvenienced. Well, they do say ‘prepare for the worst and every surprise will be a pleasant one’. Pessimism won the day here.

              Taking a peak down at the business end during delivery. The Wife’s vagina had split open like a wet paper bag trying to hold a watermelon. I’ll never forget seeing the Boy’s head poking out, clamped with forceps as the doc tugged him into reality. Fortunately the Wife was too drugged up to notice.

              I suppose I’d better get used to the notion that I now need to care for another human being. Responsibility and provision are a couple of words that spring to mind. It’s time I realise that fatherhood has started.

              As a graphic designer I love structure, my mind craves logic and thrives on order. This is a pretty useless approach when it comes to a new born baby.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s even worse when you’re using a smartphone app to track your baby’s every breath. You think you see a pattern emerging, she did this yesterday so today she should...nope! Not a chance. I hope it becomes more useful, after all it cost £3.99 (per iPhone!) and at the moment it only does two things... The first thing it’s good for is that it gives me something to stare blankly at when I’m up at 5am. The other is that I can accurately track how few hours of sleep I’m getting. Motivational for sure.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the day things are pretty smooth sailing, but the good and bad nights come in waves. The good nights are amazing and I’ve managed to get 7-8 hours sleep (albeit broken up into two or three sittings). Then there’s the bad nights. These are a lot tougher than I ever thought they’d be. I’m convinced that my daughter is secretly training to be an MI5 interrogator, specialising in sleep deprivation. After the last few nights I’m ready to sellout Queen and country for a couple of hours kip.
            </p>
            <p>
              The lack of sleep definitely leads to some frustration, especially when you’re faced with a screaming baby. The toughest times are when you've been up for hours and nothing seems to settles her, it’s hard not to get worked up. I have to remind myself that she’s not even two weeks old and if I’d only been doing something for two weeks I wouldn’t be very good at it either. She’s a baby and has no concept of time, our day and night cycle is irrelevant to her, heck she doesn’t even know she’s a baby. OK I get it, I need to cut her a little slack.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite being up in the early hours, when I’m pacing the floor with Liberty over my shoulder, I’ll catch myself in the mirror and smile. ‘Look at me, I’m a dad’. That’s when I know I can do this parenting thing.

              Breast feeding clinics are a mixed bag. On the negative side, they involve an excessive amount of waiting around, embarrassing questions and painful prodding.

            <p>
              On the positive side, the wonderful midwives provide some excellent advice and well-needed care and support. Plus, big milky boobs fly everywhere.

              I’m worried I’m existing in a temporary lull before the storm. Almost everyone I know who has children hates their lives, constantly stating how miserable they are. I can’t say I feel the same way. Is everything going to change? Will Little Crying Rock turn into Big Fucking Howling Boulder? I sincerely hope not.

              Before Liberty was born I would always joke about being the stay at home dad. Babies sleep for most of the day so all that’s left to do is stick a load of washing on then hit the Playstation for the rest of the day...ignorance is bliss isn’t it?
            </p>
            <p>
              I had no idea that the poopy nappies, feeding, burping, changing, washing, ironing, cooking and cleaning would feel so relentless. Even though I’m back at work this week the never ending treadmill trundles on, it sometimes slows but never stops. My wife now has the unenviable task of tackling this alone for 8 hours a day, I have to give her the utmost respect. The only saving grace is that she’ll get to enjoy some of Liberty’s developmental moments first hand. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little jealous.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although Liberty’s interactions have been pretty limited up to now, they are definitely building week on week. Whereas before my efforts to tickle her would be met with a blank stare, she now raises a smile. At least I assume it’s from the tickling and not just because she’s made another little present for me in her nappy. It’s exciting to see these little changes in her but I can’t help jumping forward months and years, looking forward to those big milestones. However I’ll put that to the back of my mind and live in the moment, just enjoying her blowing bubbles and that fixated look she gets when I put on a silly voice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another exciting thing we did this week was a newborn photoshoot. You know the ones, cute naked shots, leaning on their hands with their bum in the air. As angelic as those shots look I have now peeked behind the curtain... They say never work with children or animals, well my daughter is both. She managed to pee on me, the photographer and the floor as well as poop on two brand new blankets. Classy. Even after all that we managed to get some beautiful pictures so my wife and I are delighted. Although saying that, I can only hope that this is my daughter's first and last ever photoshoot with her clothes off.

              My baby smells like a coconut.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apparently dry skin is a problem with infants. It is with ours. So, following the advice of our health care worker, we’ve taken to slavering the Boy in coconut oil every day. Not cheap shit either, but the expensive stuff from Waitrose originally, now the even more expensive stuff from Sister & Co.
            </p>
            <p>
              The health care worker neglected to mention though, that by three weeks old, most babies - especially ones as black haired as mine - start to look like little coconuts too. So my child is now a living, breathing palm tree accessory.
            </p>

              I’ve started referring to him as Coco-kun (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_honorifics#Kun).

              Getting back to work full time. I'd only been doing half days for the first two weeks since the baby was born and it was nice to get back into the office properly.

              Not getting as much solitude as I'm used to. I've realised I need a lot of time to myself and, now that I'm back at work with a baby, it's harder than ever to achieve.

              Babies are a great excuse. If I'm late for work because I slept in, I just blame it on the baby. Can't be bothered going out on the weekend? Kid's fault.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can get away with murder just because you have a newborn. If I'd known how lazy I could be, I would've knocked the Wife up years ago.

              I feel bad.
            </p>
            <p>
              This week I’ve probably spent more time working than actually parenting. I’ve got my day job, I’ve taken on some extra freelance work, I’m in the throes of managing a startup business and now I’m writing this blog… I really don’t like to make things easy for myself, do I?
            </p>
            <p>
              The stress of all this has obviously gotten to me, leading to some strange and vivid dreams. Gone are my pre-baby dreams of driving cars with no breaks, these have now been replaced with me waking up thinking Liberty is in our bed, drowning under our duvet. I then spend a good five minutes rummaging through the covers to try and find her. All the while she is safe and sound, blissfully unaware, asleep in her SnüzPod. The worst one this week has to be the night I found myself crouched by our bed trying to rock our entire thing to comfort Liberty… yep she’s still over there in her own bed... If my wife had seen me I’m sure she’d think I was mad.
            </p>

              Even with all this going on, my wife and I got some time to let our hair down on our own. My sister got married last weekend and we had our first proper night out as a couple in nine months. We had a great night, enjoying the delicious food along with a few drinks. It was nice to properly relax and not be on call 24/7. I’d highly recommend this to any new parents, time just the two of us felt really healthy. We even managed to stay away from the stereotypical baby chat, it was a night for just us. Saying that, we had to cut it a little short, because in the four hours we were away our darling daughter had guzzled her way through the three bottles my wife had expressed for her and was hungry for more. Not a very well timed growth spurt Miss Liberty, but as nice as it was to have time ‘off duty’ it was lovely to come home to see her smile, squishy little pugface.

              If we rewind to earlier in the week, I got to take the reigns on a pretty major milestone in Liberty’s life. I got to feed her from a bottle for the first time. Until now she had been exclusively breast fed, something I’ve not been able to help with (obviously). Although saying that, when she’s hungry she isn’t that picky about what she latches onto. The most popular alternatives to the breast are either my neck or my upper arm. This meant she took the bottle without any trouble, she’s very much like me in that respect, if food is involved she’s not that fussy where it comes from. It felt great to now be part of the whole process.

              It’s incredible how quickly time flies. One minute you’re trying to hold your lunch in after taking a brave peak downstairs in the delivery room and the next you’re wishing you could afford a full-time nanny.

            <p>
              Hitting the one month point, it’s just started to dawn on me that the little beast isn’t going anywhere soon. Unless I can afford the boarding school fees, I’m going to be responsible for him until he's a fully grown adult. So only about 17 years and 11 months left to go.

              Going to Waitrose. It was a sign that normality is finally returning. The Boy loved it and slept contently, lapping up the gentle background hum of middle-class shopping. It helped avert some of my fears that he wasn't actually my son.

              Being woken up in the middle of the night by unexpected howls. It's the second time it's happened since he was born. Fortunately it was on the weekend.

              Everyone gets out of the way of a pram. It’s like wielding your own personal electrified snowplow. Plus if you bump into anyone, you get to scowl at them like they are the scum of the Earth.

              I’ve cooked every dinner for a month now and I’m starting to tire of it.

              Of course, my genitals don’t look like a land mine has gone off in them and I can walk down the street without peeing myself so I guess I shouldn’t really complain.
