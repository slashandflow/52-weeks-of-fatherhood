              Despite my wife’s best efforts, pushing through sickness and total exhaustion, our darling daughter didn’t want to come out that way. There was only one thing for it… out the sunroof.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the bright lights of the operating theatre, hearing the words ‘knife to skin’, it all become very real. I was seconds away from becoming a parent.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I peered over the curtain to see my daughter for the first time I struggled to grasp reality. ‘That can’t be her, can it?’ I thought. It was a wonderfully strange sensation. This little person that I’d been reading stories to for the last nine months was suddenly thrust into the world. She was now my responsibility and would rely on me for everything.
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps I was overcome with emotion, but all of a sudden I felt extremely unprepared. Despite attending two separate sets of antenatal classes, when I had to dress Liberty for the first time, I didn't have a clue. It's all good when you’re practicing on a plastic doll but nothing prepares you for dressing a wiggly, squishy, miniature human.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next two days in hospital were a breeze. Maybe this parenting thing isn’t so tough afterall? The first dirty nappy that’s like tar? No problem. Dressing and washing? Not so bad. But then this wasn’t reality. As tough as it was going home every night, I was able to sleep soundly in my own bed, void of all responsibility (and late night feeds). That was about to change.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next few nights at home were a real rollercoaster. The night she cried solidly for 3 hours from 2am really put my limited parenting repertoire to the test. Is she too hot? Is her nappy dirty? Is she getting enough food? Am I starving my child?!... It certainly sounded like it. These long stretches of turmoil are easily outweighed by the joy she can bring from a simple smile. It really is amazing.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s in these moments when she’s quiet and content that, dare I say it, this feels so easy and I can’t wait for what’s next. I just have a feeling that two weeks paternity leave just won’t feel like long enough.

              I’d heard labour described as “Apocalypse Now” and “the Exorcist in real life”. Even the midwife referred to the Labour Ward as a “torture chamber” when we heard screams - and I mean SCREAMS - emanating from down the hall. But the truth is, it was all pretty painless and straightforward, my body and mind leaving the hospital healthy and intact (I can’t say the same for the Wife’s vagina). Honestly, if I had to describe labour in one word, I would say ‘boring’.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, I was expecting to be utterly traumatised so it helps that I ended up only being mildly inconvenienced. Well, they do say ‘prepare for the worst and every surprise will be a pleasant one’. Pessimism won the day here.

              Taking a peak down at the business end during delivery. The Wife’s vagina had split open like a wet paper bag trying to hold a watermelon. I’ll never forget seeing the Boy’s head poking out, clamped with forceps as the doc tugged him into reality. Fortunately the Wife was too drugged up to notice.

              I suppose I’d better get used to the notion that I now need to care for another human being. Responsibility and provision are a couple of words that spring to mind. It’s time I realise that fatherhood has started.

              As a graphic designer I love structure, my mind craves logic and thrives on order. This is a pretty useless approach when it comes to a new born baby.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s even worse when you’re using a smartphone app to track your baby’s every breath. You think you see a pattern emerging, she did this yesterday so today she should...nope! Not a chance. I hope it becomes more useful, after all it cost £3.99 (per iPhone!) and at the moment it only does two things... The first thing it’s good for is that it gives me something to stare blankly at when I’m up at 5am. The other is that I can accurately track how few hours of sleep I’m getting. Motivational for sure.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the day things are pretty smooth sailing, but the good and bad nights come in waves. The good nights are amazing and I’ve managed to get 7-8 hours sleep (albeit broken up into two or three sittings). Then there’s the bad nights. These are a lot tougher than I ever thought they’d be. I’m convinced that my daughter is secretly training to be an MI5 interrogator, specialising in sleep deprivation. After the last few nights I’m ready to sellout Queen and country for a couple of hours kip.
            </p>
            <p>
              The lack of sleep definitely leads to some frustration, especially when you’re faced with a screaming baby. The toughest times are when you've been up for hours and nothing seems to settles her, it’s hard not to get worked up. I have to remind myself that she’s not even two weeks old and if I’d only been doing something for two weeks I wouldn’t be very good at it either. She’s a baby and has no concept of time, our day and night cycle is irrelevant to her, heck she doesn’t even know she’s a baby. OK I get it, I need to cut her a little slack.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite being up in the early hours, when I’m pacing the floor with Liberty over my shoulder, I’ll catch myself in the mirror and smile. ‘Look at me, I’m a dad’. That’s when I know I can do this parenting thing.

              Being woken up at 4am by the howls of a hungry infant on the night before my driving theory test and an important pitch. The little bastard has no sense of time.

              Breast feeding clinics are a mixed bag. On the negative side, they involve an excessive amount of waiting around, embarrassing questions and painful prodding.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the positive side, the wonderful midwives provide some excellent advice and well-needed care and support. Plus, big milky boobs fly everywhere.

              I’m worried I’m existing in a temporary lull before the storm. Almost everyone I know who has children hates their lives, constantly stating how miserable they are. I can’t say I feel the same way. Is everything going to change? Will Little Crying Rock turn into Big Fucking Howling Boulder? I sincerely hope not.

              Before Liberty was born I would always joke about being the stay at home dad. Babies sleep for most of the day so all that’s left to do is stick a load of washing on then hit the Playstation for the rest of the day...ignorance is bliss isn’t it?
            </p>
            <p>
              I had no idea that the poopy nappies, feeding, burping, changing, washing, ironing, cooking and cleaning would feel so relentless. Even though I’m back at work this week the never ending treadmill trundles on, it sometimes slows but never stops. My wife now has the unenviable task of tackling this alone for 8 hours a day, I have to give her the utmost respect. The only saving grace is that she’ll get to enjoy some of Liberty’s developmental moments first hand. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little jealous.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although Liberty’s interactions have been pretty limited up to now, they are definitely building week on week. Whereas before my efforts to tickle her would be met with a blank stare, she now raises a smile. At least I assume it’s from the tickling and not just because she’s made another little present for me in her nappy. It’s exciting to I see these little changes in her but I can’t help jumping forward months and years, looking forward to those big milestones. However I’ll put that to the back of my mind and live in the moment, just enjoying her blowing bubbles and that fixated look she gets when I put on a silly voice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another exciting thing we did this week was a newborn photoshoot. You know the ones, cute naked shots, leaning on their hands with their bum in the air. As angelic as those shots look I have now peeked behind the curtain... They say never work with children or animals, well my daughter is both. She managed to pee on me, the photographer and the floor as well as poop on two brand new blankets. Classy. Even after all that we managed to get some beautiful pictures so my wife and I are delighted. Although saying that, I can only hope that this is my daughter's first and last ever photoshoot with her clothes off.
