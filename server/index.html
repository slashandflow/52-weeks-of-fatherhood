              Despite my wife’s best efforts, pushing through sickness and total exhaustion, our darling daughter didn’t want to come out that way. There was only one thing for it… out the sunroof.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the bright lights of the operating theatre, hearing the words ‘knife to skin’, it all become very real. I was seconds away from becoming a parent.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I peered over the curtain to see my daughter for the first time I struggled to grasp reality. ‘That can’t be her, can it?’ I thought. It was a wonderfully strange sensation. This little person that I’d been reading stories to for the last nine months was suddenly thrust into the world. She was now my responsibility and would rely on me for everything.
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps I was overcome with emotion, but all of a sudden I felt extremely unprepared. Despite attending two separate sets of antenatal classes, when I had to dress Liberty for the first time, I didn't have a clue. It's all good when you’re practicing on a plastic doll but nothing prepares you for dressing a wiggly, squishy, miniature human.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next two days in hospital were a breeze. Maybe this parenting thing isn’t so tough afterall? The first dirty nappy that’s like tar? No problem. Dressing and washing? Not so bad. But then this wasn’t reality. As tough as it was going home every night, I was able to sleep soundly in my own bed, void of all responsibility (and late night feeds). That was about to change.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next few nights at home were a real rollercoaster. The night she crying solidly for 3 hours from 2am really put my limited parenting repertoire to the test. Is she too hot? Is her nappy dirty? Is she getting enough food? Am I starving my child?!... It certainly sounded like it. These long stretches of turmoil are easily outweighed by the joy she can bring from a simple smile. It really is amazing.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s in these moments when she’s quiet and content that, dare I say it, this feels so easy and I can’t wait for what’s next. I just have a feeling that two weeks paternity leave just won’t feel like long enough.
            </p>

              I’d heard labour described as “Apocalypse Now” and “the Exorcist in real life”. Even the midwife referred to the Labour Ward as a “torture chamber” when we heard screams - and I mean SCREAMS - emanating from down the hall. But the true is, it was all pretty painless and straightforward, my body and mind leaving the hospital healthy and intact (I can’t say the same for the Wife’s vagina). Honestly, if I had to describe labour in one word, I would say ‘boring’.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, I was expecting to be utterly traumatised so it helps that I ended up only being mildly inconvenienced. Well, they do say ‘prepare for the worst and every surprise will be a pleasant one’. Pessimism won the day here.
            </p>

              Realising my life wasn’t over just because I now have to carry a screaming, shitting, crying rock with me everywhere I go.

              Taking a peak down at the business end during delivery. The Wife’s vagina had split open like a wet paper bag trying to hold a watermelon. I’ll never forget seeing the Boy’s head poking out, clamped with forceps as the doc tugged him into reality. Fortunately the Wife was too drugged up to notice.

              It’s going to be a while before I visit down there again.

              I suppose I’d better get used to the notion that I now need to care for another human being. Responsibility and provision are a couple of words that spring to mind. It’s time I realise that fatherhood has started.
