              Both excited and apprehensive. Will I be a good dad? Am I ready for this? How do you know what the heck you’re doing? All that aside, I’m really looking forward to it.

              A wonderful memory box of my daughter's first year, something for her to look back on and enjoy. Plus a movie deal. I’ve always wanted Bradley Cooper to play me in a major motion picture.

              Terrified. Unprepared. Too young. Like my life is about to end. Honestly, I don’t know anyone who likes having children so I can’t say the notion appeals (but then neither does dying alone, so there’s that). Hopefully, I’ll prove that these folk are just a bunch of whiny martyrs.

              A deepeer understanding of myself, my child, and what it means to be a father. Also lots of new business for Primate.
